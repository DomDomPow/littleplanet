A moment of interaction

A simple little planet editor for you to have fun for at least 10 minutes. Do not forget to share your creations with your friends and be creative ! By the way, it is about playing with a few spheres, their radius, textures and a wonderful Perlin noise.
Technically

It is all about interactions with the interface. There are two "encapsulated" spheres. The main one and the secondary one. You can play and interact with them by using the inputs and settings on the left side of the screen.

The interactive values are the following for the main sphere :

    Sphere subdivisions
    Sphere radius
    Sphere offset-X
    Sphere offset-Y
    Perlin Noise High Frequency turbulence factor
    Perlin Noise Low Frequency turbulence factor

Inspiration

Honestly, it is a school project and I played Little Big Planet a few weeks ago. I do not really like the game but the idea of micro planets made me smile. That's why.

I tried to approach the low-poly style (because oh yeah I love it) by blocking the maximum subdivision values so the spheres cannot look perfectly smooth.

Another very complete work of that kind was made before by Oscar Westberg

This project is a full webgl project, no treejs.
